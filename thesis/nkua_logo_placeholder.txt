NKUA Logo Placeholder
====================

This is a placeholder for the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) logo.

To add the actual logo:
1. Download the official NKUA logo from the university website
2. Save it as nkua_logo.png in this directory
3. Ensure it's high resolution (at least 300 DPI)
4. The LaTeX document will automatically include it

The logo should be the official emblem of NKUA showing the goddess Athena.
