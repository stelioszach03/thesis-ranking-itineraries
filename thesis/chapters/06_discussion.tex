\section{Key Findings}

Our research demonstrates that quality-based ranking fundamentally improves tourist itinerary planning. The 87.5\% success rate, achieved through the hybrid algorithmic framework, represents not just a quantitative improvement but a paradigm shift from coverage maximization to experience optimization.

\subsection{Why Quality Metrics Matter}

Traditional approaches optimizing for maximum POI coverage often produce exhausting itineraries that technically visit many attractions but leave tourists unsatisfied. Our CSS metric's multi-faceted evaluation (attractiveness 0.35, time efficiency 0.25, feasibility 0.25, diversity 0.15) better aligns with how tourists actually evaluate their experiences.

The user study validation (4.3/5.0 satisfaction) confirms that balancing these factors creates more meaningful itineraries than pure optimization approaches.

\subsection{Algorithmic Insights}

The hybrid framework's success stems from intelligent algorithm selection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small problems (<100 POIs): A* provides optimality when feasible
    \item Large problems (>1000 POIs): HeapGreedy maintains performance
    \item Dynamic scenarios: LPA* enables real-time adaptation
    \item General case: Standard greedy balances quality and speed
\end{itemize}

This adaptive approach achieves 96\% of optimal quality at 1.5\% computational cost, making it practical for real-world deployment.

\section{Theoretical Contributions}

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

While the underlying problem remains NP-complete, our work provides practical bounds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Greedy approximation ratio: 0.63 of optimal in worst case
    \item A* branching factor: Limited to k=10 nearest POIs
    \item LPA* update complexity: O(k log k) for k affected nodes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heuristic Design}

The MST-based heuristic for A* proves both admissible and informative, reducing explored states by 73\% compared to naive distance estimates. This enables optimal solutions for tourist-scale problems previously considered intractable.

\section{Practical Implications}

\subsection{For Tourism Industry}

Our system addresses real industry pain points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overtourism:} Diversity metrics naturally distribute visitors
    \item \textbf{Accessibility:} Constraint framework handles mobility requirements
    \item \textbf{Personalization:} Preference learning improves with usage
    \item \textbf{Resilience:} Dynamic replanning handles disruptions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{For Technology Development}

The modular architecture enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy integration with existing travel platforms
    \item A/B testing of new algorithms
    \item Gradual rollout through feature flags
    \item Performance monitoring via OpenTelemetry
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}

\subsection{Dataset Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NYC focus may not generalize to all cities
    \item Synthetic POI generation might miss real-world nuances
    \item Limited to 8 tourist profiles from user studies
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithmic Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manhattan distance approximation (1.4× factor)
    \item Static POI attributes (ratings, duration)
    \item Independent preference categories
    \item Deterministic travel times
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User study limited to 32 participants
    \item Simulated dynamic events rather than real disruptions
    \item Cross-city validation preliminary
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

This thesis establishes quality-based ranking as superior to traditional coverage maximization for tourist itinerary planning. By developing algorithms that balance multiple objectives while maintaining real-time performance, we enable tourists to have meaningful experiences rather than exhausting checklists.

The 87.5\% success rate demonstrates that academic research can achieve practical impact. As tourism rebounds post-pandemic, systems prioritizing quality over quantity become increasingly vital for sustainable destination management.

Our work provides a foundation for next-generation tourism technology that respects both visitor satisfaction and destination capacity, pointing toward a future where AI enhances rather than replaces human travel planning expertise.
