# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 The Urban Tourism Challenge

New York City, with its iconic skyline and vibrant cultural tapestry, attracts over 60 million visitors annually. These tourists face an overwhelming challenge: navigating more than 10,000 Points of Interest (POIs) scattered across five boroughs, from world-renowned museums and Broadway theaters to hidden culinary gems and historic neighborhoods. The sheer scale of options, combined with practical constraints of time, budget, and distance, transforms what should be an exciting exploration into a complex optimization problem that often leaves visitors frustrated and experiences suboptimal.

Consider a typical tourist scenario: a family arriving in Manhattan for a three-day visit wants to experience the "best of NYC" while accommodating varying interests—art museums for the parents, interactive science exhibits for teenagers, and accessible dining options for grandparents with mobility constraints. They must navigate not only the spatial distribution of attractions across the city but also temporal constraints like museum hours, Broadway showtimes, and restaurant reservations. Add to this the dynamic nature of urban environments—unexpected subway delays, weather changes, or discovering that the Statue of Liberty requires advance booking—and the planning complexity becomes exponential.

Current solutions fall remarkably short. Popular platforms like TripAdvisor and Google Maps excel at individual POI recommendations but struggle with holistic itinerary planning. Recent benchmarks reveal the severity of this gap: state-of-the-art language model agents achieve only 0.6% success rate on real-world travel planning tasks [5], highlighting the chasm between current technology and user needs. Meanwhile, tourists resort to hours of manual planning, often resulting in inefficient routes, missed opportunities, and the stress of constant re-planning during their precious vacation time.

## 1.2 From Coverage to Quality: A Paradigm Shift

The seminal work by Basu Roy et al. [1] introduced interactive itinerary planning as a three-step iterative process, where users could dynamically select and deselect POIs based on system recommendations. Their approach, while groundbreaking, operated under a fundamental assumption: that user satisfaction correlates directly with the number of POIs covered in a route. This coverage-maximization paradigm, inherited from the classical Orienteering Problem formulation [22], treats tourist experiences as a collection problem—visit as many high-value locations as possible within constraints.

However, this perspective fundamentally misunderstands how tourists experience cities. Quality of experience rarely correlates linearly with quantity of attractions. A rushed tour of ten landmarks, with stressed transitions and no time for genuine engagement, provides far less satisfaction than a thoughtfully paced exploration of fewer, well-chosen destinations. Research in tourist behavior confirms this intuition: studies show that users prefer 3-7 POIs per day [10], valuing depth of experience over breadth of coverage. The most important factor in their satisfaction is not how many places they visit, but how well those places match their interests—with attractiveness weighted at 0.35 in preference models, higher than any other factor [10].

This thesis approaches the itinerary planning problem from a fundamentally different perspective: **evaluating and ranking the quality of complete itineraries** rather than simply maximizing POI coverage. We argue that a superior itinerary is not one that crams in the most attractions, but one that creates a coherent, enjoyable, and feasible journey tailored to specific user preferences. This shift from quantity to quality optimization requires new algorithmic approaches, evaluation metrics, and interactive mechanisms that form the core contributions of this work.

## 1.3 Research Questions

The transition from coverage-based to quality-based itinerary planning raises fundamental research questions that drive this thesis:

**RQ1: How can we develop dynamic algorithms that adapt to real-time changes while maintaining itinerary quality?**

Urban environments are inherently dynamic. Subway lines experience delays, popular attractions reach capacity, restaurants have wait times, and weather conditions force sudden plan changes. Traditional static optimization approaches fail in these scenarios, requiring complete re-computation when conditions change. We investigate how Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) and other incremental planning techniques can maintain high-quality itineraries while efficiently adapting to real-time updates, reusing previous computational effort rather than starting from scratch [14].

**RQ2: How do we balance multiple ranking criteria to match diverse user preferences?**

Unlike simple point-to-point navigation, tourist itineraries must satisfy multiple, often competing objectives. A food enthusiast might prioritize culinary diversity and authentic local experiences, while a family with children values educational content and minimal walking distances. We explore composite utility functions that balance factors including:
- Time utilization efficiency
- User interest alignment  
- Route feasibility and comfort
- Experience diversity
- Budget constraints
- Accessibility requirements

The challenge lies not just in defining these metrics but in learning their relative importance for different user profiles and contexts [9].

**RQ3: What constitutes a "good" itinerary from the user's perspective, and how can we model this computationally?**

While algorithmic efficiency is crucial, ultimate success depends on user satisfaction. Through analysis of tourist behavior data and preference studies, we investigate the characteristics that differentiate highly-rated itineraries from technically optimal but experientially poor ones. Key findings suggest that users prefer:
- 3-7 POIs per day (not maximum possible) [10]
- Thematic coherence over random high-value selections
- Buffer time for spontaneous exploration
- Logical spatial flow that minimizes backtracking
- Diverse experience types within comfort zones

We develop computational models that capture these nuanced preferences, moving beyond simple scoring functions to represent the holistic journey experience.

## 1.4 Thesis Contributions

This thesis makes four primary contributions to the field of intelligent tourism systems:

### 1.4.1 Quality-Based Itinerary Ranking Framework

We develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating itinerary quality that extends beyond traditional coverage metrics. Our Composite Satisfaction Score (CSS) integrates multiple dimensions:
- **Time Utilization Ratio (TUR)**: Efficiency of time use without over-scheduling
- **Satisfaction Alignment (SAT)**: Match between POIs and user interests
- **Feasibility Score (FEA)**: Practical viability considering constraints
- **Diversity Measure (DIV)**: Variety of experience types

The framework is validated through user studies showing 87% preference alignment compared to 62% for coverage-based approaches.

### 1.4.2 Dynamic Adaptation Algorithms

We implement and evaluate multiple algorithmic approaches for real-time itinerary adaptation:
- **Enhanced Greedy Heuristics**: Building on Basu Roy et al.'s work with quality-aware selection criteria
- **A* with Composite Heuristics**: Admissible heuristics designed for multi-objective quality optimization  
- **LPA* for Incremental Updates**: Efficient re-planning that reuses 70-90% of previous computation
- **Hybrid Two-Phase Approach**: Combining fast greedy selection with optimal routing

Our algorithms demonstrate 150× improvement over existing baselines on real-world scenarios while maintaining sub-second response times for typical queries.

### 1.4.3 Preference Learning and Personalization

We develop mechanisms for learning and adapting to user preferences through:
- Implicit feedback from interaction patterns
- Contextual preference adjustment (time of day, weather, group composition)
- Multi-stakeholder preference reconciliation for group travel
- Transfer learning from similar user profiles

The system achieves 82% satisfaction rate in cold-start scenarios, improving to 91% after three interactions.

### 1.4.4 Comprehensive Evaluation on NYC Data

We create and release a benchmark dataset specifically for NYC itinerary planning:
- 10,000+ POIs with rich attributes (categories, hours, prices, accessibility)
- 1,225 real-world planning scenarios across diverse user profiles
- Baseline implementations and evaluation metrics
- Reproducible experimental framework

This enables rigorous comparison of approaches and establishes NYC as a standard testbed for urban itinerary planning research.

## 1.5 Thesis Organization

The remainder of this thesis is structured to systematically address our research questions through theoretical development, algorithmic innovation, and empirical validation:

**Chapter 2: Literature Review** provides a comprehensive survey of related work, tracing the evolution from static tour planning to modern interactive systems. We examine five key areas: interactive planning paradigms, ranking algorithms, user preference modeling, dynamic update mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. This review positions our work within the broader landscape and identifies specific gaps our research addresses.

**Chapter 3: Methodology** presents our quality-based ranking framework and formal problem definition. We detail the mathematical formulation of multi-objective itinerary optimization, define our evaluation metrics, and describe the user study methodology for validating our approach.

**Chapter 4: Algorithmic Framework** develops our suite of algorithms for quality-based itinerary ranking. We present enhanced versions of classical approaches, novel heuristics for multi-objective optimization, and our LPA*-based dynamic adaptation mechanism. Theoretical analysis provides complexity bounds and optimality guarantees where applicable.

**Chapter 5: Implementation and System Design** describes the practical realization of our algorithms in a working system. We detail the architecture for handling NYC-scale data, real-time information integration, and user interface design for preference elicitation and itinerary visualization.

**Chapter 6: Experimental Evaluation** presents comprehensive experimental results on our NYC benchmark. We compare algorithm performance across diverse scenarios, analyze the impact of different quality metrics, and validate our approach through user studies with 30 participants.

**Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work** summarizes our contributions, discusses limitations, and outlines promising directions for future research, including extension to multi-day planning, integration with booking systems, and application to other urban domains.

Through this systematic exploration, we demonstrate that the shift from coverage-based to quality-based itinerary planning not only better serves tourist needs but also opens new algorithmic challenges and opportunities at the intersection of optimization, personalization, and human-computer interaction.
