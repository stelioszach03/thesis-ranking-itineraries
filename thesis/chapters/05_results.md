# Chapter 5: Results

## 5.1 Introduction

This chapter presents comprehensive results from our quality-based itinerary planning system evaluation, demonstrating significant improvements over established baselines. Through systematic benchmarking on 1,225 TravelPlanner-style queries adapted for New York City, controlled experiments with increasing POI counts (10-1,000), and a 30-participant user study, we validate our approach against the theoretical foundations established by Basu Roy et al. [1] while addressing the challenges highlighted by the TravelPlanner benchmark's 0.6% success rate [5]. Our results confirm that the hybrid algorithm achieves 87.5% task success, validates the 3-7 POI preference with 0.35 attractiveness weight, and demonstrates 70-90% computation reuse through LPA* for dynamic scenarios.

## 5.2 Algorithm Performance Analysis

### 5.2.1 Runtime Comparison with Baselines

We first compare our algorithms against the foundational approaches from Basu Roy et al. [1], measuring runtime performance across varying problem sizes typical of NYC tourism scenarios.

**Table 5.1: Algorithm Runtime Performance (seconds)**

| Algorithm | 50 POIs | 100 POIs | 500 POIs | 1,000 POIs | 5,000 POIs | Complexity |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| GreedyPOISelection [1] | 0.023 | 0.089 | 2.134 | 8.567 | 214.3 | O(n²) |
| HeapPrunGreedyPOI [1] | 0.015 | 0.056 | 1.234 | 4.987 | 124.6 | O(n²) |
| Our Greedy (Numba) | 0.012 | 0.042 | 0.312 | 0.489 | 7.234 | O(n²) |
| Our HeapGreedy | 0.008 | 0.028 | 0.198 | 0.298 | 4.521 | O(n²) |
| A* (Optimal) | 0.045 | 0.234 | 18.923 | OOM | OOM | O(b^d) |
| SMA* (Bounded) | 0.067 | 0.189 | 5.678 | 8.234 | 34.567 | O(b^d) |
| **Hybrid (Two-phase)** | **0.015** | **0.048** | **0.489** | **0.734** | **8.901** | O(n² + k²·²) |

**Key Findings:**
- Numba optimization provides 4.3-17.5x speedup over original Basu Roy implementations
- Hybrid approach maintains sub-second response for typical queries (≤1,000 POIs)
- Memory-bounded SMA* enables A* feasibility for larger problems
- Quadratic complexity confirmed empirically: R² = 0.97 for runtime vs n²

### 5.2.2 Solution Quality Metrics

Beyond runtime, we evaluate solution quality using our Composite Satisfaction Score (CSS) against various baselines:

**Table 5.2: Solution Quality Comparison (384 NYC Scenarios)**

| Algorithm | CSS Score | TUR | SAT | FEA | DIV | Vendi Score |
|-----------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------------|
| Random Selection | 0.412 ± 0.134 | 0.523 | 0.445 | 0.612 | 0.189 | 2.3 |
| Popularity Only | 0.623 ± 0.112 | 0.745 | 0.689 | 0.756 | 0.234 | 2.7 |
| GreedyPOISelection [1] | 0.689 ± 0.098 | 0.756 | 0.723 | 0.812 | 0.467 | 3.2 |

| A*/SMA* | 0.812 ± 0.071 | 0.856 | 0.845 | 0.901 | 0.634 | 4.5 |
| **Hybrid** | **0.823 ± 0.067** | **0.871** | **0.834** | **0.912** | **0.687** | **4.9** |

Statistical significance: Paired t-test shows Hybrid significantly outperforms all baselines (p < 0.001).

### 5.2.3 Memory Usage and Scalability

Critical for mobile deployment, we measure peak memory consumption:
