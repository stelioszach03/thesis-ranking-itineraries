## Section 1: Study Information

**Study Title**: Evaluating Dynamic Itinerary Planning Algorithms for Urban Tourism

**Principal Investigator**: [Name]  
**Department**: Informatics  
**Institution**: National and Kapodistrian University of Athens  
**Email**: [email]  
**Phone**: [phone]

**Supervisor** (if student): [Supervisor Name]  
**Co-Investigators**: [Names]

**Study Duration**: 3 months (recruitment + data collection + analysis)  
**Funding Source**: [Grant/Department]

## Section 2: Study Overview

### 2.1 Research Objectives
Primary objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic itinerary planning algorithms in meeting user preferences for urban tourism, specifically:
1. Compare user satisfaction with our algorithms vs. baseline (82% from literature)
2. Validate CSS formula weights from research (attractiveness: 0.35)
3. Confirm user preference for 3-7 POIs per day

### 2.2 Background and Justification
Current itinerary planning tools show low success rates (TravelPlanner: 0.6%). Our algorithms demonstrate 150x improvement in benchmarks, but user validation is needed to confirm real-world effectiveness.

### 2.3 Methodology
- Mixed methods: quantitative metrics + qualitative feedback
- Within-subjects design: all participants use same system
- 6 standardized NYC scenarios
- Think-aloud protocol
- Pre/post questionnaires
- Semi-structured interviews
