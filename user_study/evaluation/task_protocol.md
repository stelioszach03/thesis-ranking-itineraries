# Task Protocol

## Setup (Per Participant)

### Before Participant Arrives
1. Reset system to clean state
2. Load participant's scenario order from randomization
3. Start screen recording software
4. Prepare consent forms
5. Test all equipment

### Participant Arrival
1. Welcome and offer refreshments
2. Review consent form together
3. Obtain signatures
4. Assign participant ID (P001-P030)

## Introduction (5 minutes)

### Script
"Thank you for participating in our study. Today you'll be using our itinerary planning system to plan several tourist days in New York City. 

The system will help you:
- Select points of interest
- Optimize routes
- Consider timing and constraints
- Create complete itineraries

Please think aloud as you work - tell us what you're thinking, what you're looking for, and why you're making certain choices. There are no right or wrong answers - we're interested in how you use the system.

Do you have any questions before we begin?"

### System Training
1. Show main interface
2. Demonstrate basic features:
   - POI search
   - Adding/removing stops
   - Viewing route
   - Adjusting times
   - Algorithm selection
3. Practice scenario (5 minutes)
4. Answer any questions

## Main Tasks (30 minutes)

### For Each Scenario (5 minutes each)

1. **Present Scenario**
   - Read scenario description
   - Highlight key constraints
   - Clarify any questions

2. **During Task**
   - Remind to think aloud if quiet > 30 seconds
   - Use prompts from scenario if needed
   - Note any difficulties or confusion
   - Don't provide hints unless stuck > 2 minutes

3. **Task Completion**
   - Save final itinerary
   - Quick satisfaction rating (1-10)
   - Any immediate feedback?

### Between Tasks
- 30-second break
- "Ready for the next scenario?"
- Check recording is still running

## Think-Aloud Prompts

Use these if participant is quiet:
- "What are you thinking about right now?"
- "What are you looking for?"
- "Why did you choose that option?"
- "What would you expect to happen next?"
- "Is this what you expected?"

## Researcher Observations

For each task, note:
- [ ] Start time
- [ ] First action taken
- [ ] Algorithm selection (if any)
- [ ] Number of POIs added/removed
- [ ] Number of route recalculations
- [ ] Use of filters/search
- [ ] Confusion points
- [ ] Positive reactions
- [ ] Completion time
- [ ] Success (meets scenario requirements)

## Common Issues & Responses

**Participant asks which algorithm to use**
→ "Choose whatever seems best for your needs"

**Participant can't find specific POI**
→ After 2 min: "Try searching for [category] instead"

**System error/bug**
→ Note the error, refresh, continue
→ If persistent: skip to next scenario

**Participant frustrated**
→ "Remember this is testing the system, not you"
→ "Would you like to move to the next task?"

**Participant asks for optimal solution**
→ "Plan what you think would work best"

## Emergency Protocols

**Participant wants to stop**
→ Stop immediately, thank them, full compensation

**Technical failure**
→ Try backup laptop
→ If impossible: reschedule, full compensation

**Fire alarm/evacuation**
→ Follow building procedures
→ Reschedule, full compensation

## Data Saving Checklist

After each scenario:
- [ ] Itinerary auto-saved
- [ ] Interaction log captured
- [ ] Screen recording ongoing
- [ ] Observation notes updated

After all scenarios:
- [ ] Export all itineraries
- [ ] Save interaction logs
- [ ] Stop screen recording
- [ ] Back up all data

## Transition to Post-Study

"Great job! You've completed all the planning tasks. Now I'd like to ask you some questions about your experience..."
